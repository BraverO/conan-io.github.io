title: Be a Barbarian. Join the Conan team.
# other options
---


Since conan joined JFrog, the growth has been incredible, nowadays, there are many companies all around the globe using conan in production to manage their C and C++ libraries and packages. While we are very excited and happy of conan success, this creates some constraints: giving support and help to active users, which depend on conan for their tasks, is a great responsibility and a high priority, but also takes a lot of time. Also, product improvement (design, development, testing) to address active users needs, is a continuous task that only increases with the user base.

So we have reached a point in which more Barbarians are needed in the team. Are you willing to become one?

Software Engineers: Developer Advocate and Product
===================================================

We would like to hire at least 2 Software Engineers. Both will be very technical roles, and be part of the conan core team, taking responsibility of all different tasks we are already doing:
- Product development, testing, releasing, documenting
- Community support and help
- Participating in conferences and other events, writing tech blog posts.
- Conan-center: curating, reviewing and creating OSS packages

Both roles require experience and skills as Software Engineer, mainly in the area of C/C++ build engineering (multiplatform building, compilers, build-systems, Continuous Integration, etc). 

The Developer Advocate position will be more focused on the Community, but will be also doing development, as a high expertise and knowledge of conan is required. Some community leadership, experience in speaking at conferences, writing related blog posts, etc is required.

The Product SW Engineer will be more focused on development, but will also participate in all other tasks. Strong skills in design, development and testing systems, preferably in the dev-tools area, are desired.

Both roles will require a good level of English, spoken and written, bonus points with experience in Python, OSS communities, and/or conan.


Join conan, leap forward with JFrog
====================================

Conan is now part of JFrog, so joining the conan team you will be part of JFrog. JFrog, the creators of Artifactory, Bintray, XRay, has been awarded as one of the world's fastest growing companies.

</p>

So you will be part of a small team, in a very dynamic, challenging, relevant and fast growing OSS project, but also be part of a leading company in the field

The conan team is remote. We donâ€™t have a central office, and we work in a flexible way and schedule, remotely, and travelling from time to time to events and to meet together to work. Of course, if you can join any of the company offices in SunnyVale, Israel, Toulouse, Bangalore, Madrid, you will be very welcome, but it is not a requirement.
